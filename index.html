  <!-- About Me -->
  <section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6" id="about">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-2">About Me</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300">
      I'm Delora — an Information Technology student at Kumaraguru College of Technology with a deepening curiosity for cybersecurity and ethical hacking.
      I’m someone who finds quiet satisfaction in finishing what I start — even when it frustrates me. I enjoy learning new things not just for the knowledge, but for the challenge. There’s something deeply rewarding in sticking with a problem until it clicks.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
      I’m not here to draw attention to myself — not loudly, anyway. But I do hope that, little by little, the work I do leaves a subtle mark. Whether it’s through tools I build, problems I help solve, or insights I share — I want my presence to be felt even if it’s not always seen.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
      Recently, I’ve surprised myself by enjoying areas I once avoided — like hardware. The deeper I explore, the more fascinated I become by the layers of technology and the systems that hackers understand so well.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
      I'm working steadily toward my next big goal — a Master's in Cyber Security and Penetration Testing at Middlesex University. Along the way, I'm participating in hackathons, CTFs, and ideathons that challenge and grow my skills.
