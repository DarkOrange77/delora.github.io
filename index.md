title: About Me

# Hi, I'm Delora — a student of Information Technology with a growing curiosity for cybersecurity and ethical hacking.

I’m someone who finds quiet satisfaction in finishing what I start — even when it frustrates me. I enjoy learning new things not just for the knowledge, but for the challenge. There’s something deeply rewarding in sticking with a problem until it clicks.

I’m not here to draw attention to myself — not loudly, anyway. But I do hope that, little by little, the work I do leaves a subtle mark. Whether it’s through tools I build, problems I help solve, or insights I share — I want my presence to be felt even if it’s not always seen.

Recently, I’ve surprised myself by learning to enjoy hardware — something I used to avoid. The deeper I go, the more I realize how fascinating the layers of tech can be. One day, I hope to understand the systems hackers build and use — not just in theory, but from the inside out.

This is only the beginning.
But I’m building steadily — and I’m not stopping here.
